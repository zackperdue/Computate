# Computate Coda 2 Plugin

The computate plugin for coda 2 plugin is my first attempt at a plugin for coda. 
The need for the plugin became apparent when I started dealing with responsive website layouts.
Since responsive design usually deals with ems or percentages, and often to large decimal places,
it became necessary to perform calculations quickly. 

## How it works

Install the plugin, just open it with Coda 2.

- Type an arithmetic expression that you would like evaluated
- Highlight the expression itself
- Hit **`Cmd + Y`** on the keyboard

The plugin replaces the expression with the result.
